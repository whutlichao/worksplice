# worksplice

[中文文档](./README.zh-CN.md)

Local workspace for collaborating with persistent [pi coding agent](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) sessions. worksplice reads your local pi session files and gives you a browser workspace for session browsing, real-time chat, model configuration, skill management, and project file preview.

## Quick Start

worksplice requires Node.js 22.19.0 or newer. Check your version with `node --version`.

**Run without installing:**

```bash
npx worksplice@latest
```

**Or install globally:**

```bash
npm install -g worksplice
worksplice
```

Then open [http://127.0.0.1:30142](http://127.0.0.1:30142). The CLI will try to open the browser automatically after the server is ready. worksplice listens on `127.0.0.1` by default.

**Options:**

```bash
worksplice --port 8080              # custom port
worksplice --hostname 0.0.0.0       # expose on a trusted network
worksplice -p 8080 -H 0.0.0.0       # combine options
worksplice --no-open                # do not open the browser automatically

PORT=8080 worksplice                # environment variable is also supported
WORKSPLICE_HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0 worksplice  # explicit network exposure
WORKSPLICE_ALLOWED_HOSTS=worksplice.internal worksplice  # allow an exact proxy/custom hostname
WORKSPLICE_PASSWORD='a-long-random-password' worksplice  # require Basic Auth (username: pi)
WORKSPLICE_NO_OPEN=1 worksplice     # useful when running as a background service
```

Set `WORKSPLICE_PASSWORD` to protect the web interface and every API endpoint with HTTP Basic Auth. The username is always `pi`. Leaving the variable unset or empty disables authentication.

worksplice can invoke a high-privilege agent. Basic Auth does not encrypt the password in transit, so do not expose plain HTTP to the internet. Use HTTPS through a trusted reverse proxy or a trusted VPN for remote access.
API requests accept loopback names, IP literals, the selected bind hostname, and exact comma-separated names in `WORKSPLICE_ALLOWED_HOSTS`. Configure that variable when a trusted reverse proxy uses a different external hostname.

## HTTP Proxy

worksplice reads the standard `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, and `NO_PROXY` environment variables for server-side model and API requests.

On macOS or Linux:

```bash
HTTP_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:7890 \
HTTPS_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:7890 \
NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1 \
npx worksplice@latest
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:HTTP_PROXY = "http://127.0.0.1:7890"
$env:HTTPS_PROXY = "http://127.0.0.1:7890"
$env:NO_PROXY = "localhost,127.0.0.1"
npx worksplice@latest
```

## Features

- **Pick work back up**: browse previous pi conversations by project without digging through terminal history or session paths.
- **Try different directions safely**: continue from an earlier message or fork a session into a separate route.
- **Work across branches**: switch Git worktrees from the sidebar so new sessions and the Explorer follow the checkout you choose.
- **Chat beside the project**: browse files on the left and preview source, docs, images, audio, and PDFs on the right while the agent works.
- **See session state clearly**: context usage, cost, compaction state, and system prompt details are visible from the top bar.
- **Configure less from the terminal**: manage models, login/API keys, model tests, and skill switches from the web UI.
- **Use the interface in your language**: switch between the supported UI languages from the top bar.

## Notes

- **Data directory**: worksplice reads `~/.pi/agent/sessions` by default. Set `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` to point at another pi agent directory.
- **Session files**: files are stored as `~/.pi/agent/sessions/<encoded-cwd>/<timestamp>_<uuid>.jsonl`.
- **Model config**: the Models panel reads and writes `models.json` in the pi agent directory. Model lists and defaults come from pi's config.
- **File access**: file browsing and preview are scoped to the selected project directory and working directories that appear in sessions.
- **Git worktrees**: see [Worktrees in worksplice](./docs/worktrees.md) for when the switcher appears, how new worktrees are created, and what removal does.
- **Forks vs in-session branches**: Fork creates a new `.jsonl` file. "Edit from here" creates another branch inside the same session file.
- **Internationalization**: see [Internationalization](./docs/i18n.md) for using translations and adding languages or UI text.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The local dev server runs at [http://127.0.0.1:30142](http://127.0.0.1:30142).

Common checks:

```bash
node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit
npm run lint
```

Avoid running `next build` / `npm run build` during local development. It writes to `.next/` and can interfere with the dev server; leave builds for release work.
